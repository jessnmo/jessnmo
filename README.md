As mentioned I'm currently transitioning my career to software development, I'm actively looking for a new opportunity! 

I decided to transition my career to software engineering after working closely with engineers for almost 6 years in operations. I believe that continuous practice, self-driven learning, and a passion for the craft are key to becoming a great engineer, and I am committed to honing my technical skills to achieve this goal.

My experience in stakeholder management, project management, and communication has equipped me with soft skills that I can bring to my work as an engineer. I am now seeking to join a team that gives me opportunities to grow my technical expertise and work collaboratively to solve challenging problems.

Ready to work together! ✨
